This is the first project from The Odin Project curriculum. The objective is to deconstruct the Google Homepage using Developer Tools and rebuild it. This will be my first attempt as creating a web page.

Note: I first built the webpage without using Developer Tools - this is all in the folder "no_dev_tools". Then I made some changes after viewing the original web page with Chrome's Developer Tools and saved that in the folder "with_dev_tools".

Skills demonstrated:
- Create an html document.
- Apply CSS to an html document.
- Use Git to save my work to Github.
- Center elements, images, and text horizontally and vertically.
- Place an image in a search form.
- Add style to page including underline link text upon hovering over it and automatically placing cursor in search form when first reaching a webpage.
- Pull images from an existing webpage and use them on my webpage.
- Use Google to answer questions and help with tasks I was unable to do.
- Use Developer Tools to gather information about a web page including colors and fonts.
