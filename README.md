This is the first project from The Odin Project curriculum. The objective is to deconstruct the Google Homepage using Developer Tools and rebuild it. This will be my first attempt as creating a web page.

Note: I first built the webpage without using Developer Tools, this is all in the folder "NoDevTools". The files in "WithDevTools" were modified after using Chrome's Developer Tools to inspect the original page.

Skills demonstrated:
- Using Developer Tools to gather information about a web page.
- Create an html document.
- Apply CSS to an html document.
- Use Git to save my work to Github.
- (more to come after completing the project...)
